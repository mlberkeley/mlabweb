  				<p>Machine Learning at Berkeley is proud to be offering a new DeCal this semester, the Impact of AI DeCal! As AI becomes increasingly woven into the daily fabric of our lives, there is a greater need for understanding how it will affect the world we share. We hope that by exploring various economic, social, and ethical challenges facing AI in an interactive format, we can spark a conversation that reaches across disciplines to find solutions. No technical knowledge of AI/ML is needed. Find out more and apply <%= link_to 'on our DeCal page', "https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4542", target: "_blank" %>.
