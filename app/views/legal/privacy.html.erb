         <h3>How we collect information about you</h3>

         <p>When you visit the My App website, use My App Services, or use third-party services which use the My App application programming interface ("API"), we collect information sent to us through your computer, mobile phone, or other access device. This information may include your IP address, device information including, but not limited to, identifier, device name and type, operating system, location, mobile network information and standard web log information, such as your browser type, traffic to and from our site and the pages you accessed on our website. You must be at least 18 years old, or of the applicable age of majority, in order to use My App Services. My App does not intentionally collect information from or about any individual who is under 13 years old.</p>

         <p>If you create an account or use My App Services, we, or our affiliates vendors acting on our behalf may collect the following types of information:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Contact information - your name, address, phone, email, Skype ID and other similar information.</li>
         <li>Financial information - the full credit card numbers you provide when you pay for My App Services. We do not collect this information if you pay with Bitcoin.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>When you use My App Services, we collect information about your transactions and/or your other activities on our website and we may continuously collect information about your computer, mobile device, or other access device for fraud prevention purposes, to monitor for possible breach of your My App Account, and to identify any malicious software or other activity that may harm My App or its users.</p>

         <p>You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter). The information we have access to varies by site and is controlled by your privacy settings on that site and your authorization. By associating an account managed by a third party with your My App account and authorizing My App to have access to this information, you agree that My App may collect, store and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

         <p>Finally, we may collect additional information you may disclose to our customer support team.</p>

         <h3>How we use cookies</h3>

         <p>When you access our website or content or use our application or My App Services, we or companies we work with may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Recognize you as a My App customer;</li>
         <li>Customize My App Services, content, and advertising;</li>
         <li>Measure promotional effectiveness; and</li>
         <li>Collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud and promote trust and safety.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.</p>

         <p>We also use Local Shared Objects, commonly referred to as "Flash cookies," to help ensure that your account security is not compromised, to spot irregularities in behavior to help prevent fraud and to support our sites and services.</p>

         <p>We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting or disabling cookies.</p>

         <p>You may encounter My App cookies or pixel tags on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie or pixel tag placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and the My App Privacy Policy does not cover their use.</p>

         <h3>How we protect and store personal information</h3>

         <p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user. My App takes reasonable precautions, as described herein, to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

         <p>We store and process your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, on our computers in the United States and elsewhere in the world where My App facilities or our service providers are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. Full credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by a payment vendor in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). This information is not accessible to My App staff.</p>

         <p>We store our customers' personal information securely throughout the life of the customer's My App Account. My App will retain your personal information for a minimum of five years or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>

         <h3>How we use the personal information we collect</h3>

         <p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Provide My App Services and customer support you request;</li>
         <li>Process transactions and send notices about your transactions;</li>
         <li>Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
         <li>Prevent and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and/or violations of our posted user terms;</li>
         <li>Customize, measure, and improve My App Services and the content and layout of our website and applications;</li>
         <li>Deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and</li>
         <li>Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>We will not use your personal information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission. From time to time we may request your permission to allow us to share your personal information with third parties. You may opt out of having your personal information shared with third parties, or from allowing us to use your personal information for any purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which we originally collected it or subsequently obtained your authorization. If you choose to so limit the use of your personal information, certain features or My App Services may not be available to you.</p>

         <h3>Marketing</h3>

         <p>We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize My App Services, content and advertising.</p>

         <h3>How we share personal information with other parties</h3>

         <p>We may share your personal information with:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.</li>
         <li>Financial institutions with which we partner.</li>
         <li>Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)</li>
         <li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:

         <ul>
         <li>We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure; or</li>
         <li>We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li>Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>My App will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy. Before My App shares your information with any third party that is not acting as an agent to perform tasks on behalf of and under the instructions of My App, My App will first ensure that the third party either subscribes to the Principles, or is subject to the European Union's Directive on Data Protection, or enters into a written agreement with My App requiring that the third party will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as required by the Principles.</p>

         <p>If you establish a My App account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a My App website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.</p>

         <p>In general, we will notify you of material changes to this policy by updating the last updated date at the top of this page, and we will provide you with explicit notice of material changes as required by law. We recommend that you visit this page frequently to check for changes.</p>

         <h3>How you can access or change your personal information</h3>

         <p>You are entitled to review, correct, or amend your personal information, or to delete that information where it is inaccurate, and you may do so at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or Account tab. This right shall only be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. If you close your My App account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep your account information in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

         <h3>How you can contact us about privacy questions</h3>

         <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us at <a href="mailto:address@example.com">address@example.com</a> or by writing to us at My App, 123 Any Street, Folksville, USA.</p>
