  <p>We will be hosting our Fall 2018 club info sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday August 28thth and 29thst, from 8pm to 10pm, in the Wozniak Lounge (Soda Hall). If you like Machine Learning and think you might be interested in joining ML@B, be sure to come by!</p>

  <h3>Machine Learning Decal</h3>
  <p>We are hosting our introductory Machine Learning Decal again this semester! The decal is a chance for those who are familiar with programming to try their hand at analyzing and manipulating data in python, and experimenting with various machine learing and statistical methods. Recommended for those who have taken cs61a, data8, stats 133, or an equivalent. Find out more and apply <%= link_to 'on our DeCal page', "https://ml.berkeley.edu/decals/MLD", target: "_blank" %>. Applications are due Friday, August 31st at 11:59pm.</p>

  <h3>Impact of AI Decal</h3>
  <p>Machine Learning at Berkeley is proud to be offering a new DeCal this semester, the Impact of AI DeCal! As AI becomes increasingly woven into the daily fabric of our lives, there is a greater need for understanding how it will affect the world we share. We hope that by exploring various economic, social, and ethical challenges facing AI in an interactive format, we can spark a conversation that reaches across disciplines to find solutions. No technical knowledge of AI/ML is needed. Find out more and apply <%= link_to 'on our DeCal page', "https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4542", target: "_blank" %>. Applications are due by Friday, August 31st at 11:59 PM</p>

  <h3>Demo Day</h3>
  <p>Being a member of ML@B means being a member of a vibrant community of students who are passionate about what they're working on. Demo Days provide our members the chance to not only show off the work they've been doing, but also learn about what the rest of the ML@B community is working on. These will be publicized once they happen later on in the semester.</p>

  <h3>Various Talks and Workshops</h3>
  <p>ML@B hosts a variety of technical talks and educational workshops throughout the semester. These events are open to the public but are especially encouraged for new members who want to gain insight into the machine learning community. We've done workshops on Tensorflow and introductory Natural Language Processing, among many other topics. Some of our past speakers have included Adobe Research's Aaron Hertzmann, Google Brain's Ian Goodfellow, and Comma.ai's George Hotz. Check out our calendar for updated info on events!</p>
